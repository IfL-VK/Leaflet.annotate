        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          This plugin extends the options for the LeafletJS Standard API elements Marker, CircleMarker, Popup, ImageOverlay and GeoJSON so you can publish these elements in HTML semantically annotated with machine readable geo markup. While others conceive, talk and develop new geospatial data catalogs which are awesome this plugin turns the focus onto geographic web maps acknowleding that, in fact, some maps we publish are already data catalogs. They are just not that well represented in HTML so that other programs can extract and re-use the information people aggregate and visualize with them. So to make some of the most important geographic elements to be published by the year 2025 on the web in HTML
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>identifiable and addressable for others,</li>
            <li>searchable for users through search engines,</li>
            <li>re-usable and interoperable for application developers,</li>
            <li>real collections of linked data and therewith,</li>
            <li>potentially multilingual and</li>
            <li>self-contained and reproducible</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p>Therefore we wrote this small script, integrating freeing you of caring much about the necessary syntax details.</p>
        
        <p>This is (as LeafletJS itself) BSD Licensed open source software. Your feedback or contributions are very welcome. Please use <a href="/ifl-geovis/Leaflet.annotate">this issue tracker</a> to report any issues you experienced with it.</p>

        <h1>Installation</h1>

        <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>
        
        <p>The source code released contains two different components.<p>
        
        <p>The core file is the semantic markup generating Leaflet Plugin in <br/><code>Leaflet.annotate.Microdata.js</code></p>
        
        <p>An add-on which operates on the semantic markup generated by the core component is in <br/><code>Leaflet.annotate.Viewer.js</code>Using this add-on you can add a text based search control to your map allowing readers of it to magically <em>list</em>, <em>search</em> and <em>focus</em> all your annotated web map elements.</p>
        
        <p>Furthemore, to assist the creation of valid semantic markup. Currently you can choose between two JavaScript objects, one in english and one in german language, which helps you to map user inpuot to valid Schema.org <code>itemtype</code> options. We ship this to help you validate user input you pass on to the core generating the markup for you.</p>
