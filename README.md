## Leaflet.annnotate

A plugin for [LeafletJS](http://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) based web-maps allowing authors of geographical web maps to publish the contents of their web map as structured and accessible data. We therefore rely on integrating the public [Schema.org vocabulary](http://schema.org) exposing the contents of our maps as an unordered list of distinct but _typed_ entities.

We furthermore aim to employ and revise the markup generated around core mapping elements (LeafletJS: Marker, Popup and Overlay) according to our investigations of the [Dublin Core Metadata Element Set](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) and/or through relying on parts of the current [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html).

The envisioned application for revised markup in geographic web maps is (besides all third-party use cases enabled through providing structured data):<br/> A digital map legend interactively assisting users in analyzing the contents and the scope of so called ``map mashups''.

### Implementation Notes

To annotate SVG Elements we introduce a `metadata` Element next to the respective `path`. In practice both are often grouped within a `g` element.

Maps rendered in the **Internet Explorer** along with _VML_ is currently **not supported** when deploying Leaflet.annnotate.

### Terms Currently Supported

| HTML Marker   |      SVG Marker and Geometric Overlays      |  HTML Popups |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Place, City (with GeoCoordinates) |  AdministrativeArea (with GeoShape)<br/>CreativeWork, Place (with GeoCoordinates) | No |

### Building Annotations

Annotating simple Leaflet Marker (IMG) representing a [Place](http://schema.org/Place) in the [City](http://schema.org/City) of New York.
Automatically exposes this markers location values as machine readable [GeoCoordinates](http://schema.org/GeoCoordinates).
<pre>
var marker = L.marker([40.573112, -73.980740], { itemtype: 'Place', title: 'New York City'})
</pre>

Annotating a simple Leaflet Circle Marker (SVG) as representing a [Creative Work](http://schema.org/CreativeWork), virtual Poem.
Automatically exposes this markers location value as machine readable [GeoCoordinates](http://schema.org/GeoCoordinates).
<pre>
var circleMarker = L.circleMarker([40.573112, -73.980740], { itemtype: 'CreativeWork'
    title: 'The circle marker locating this meta poem geographically.'
})
</pre>

Annotating a group of geometries (SVG) as representing the [Administrative Area](http://schema.org/AdministrativeArea) of the United States.
Exposes this polygons location values as machine readable [GeoShape](http://schema.org/GeoShape).
<pre>
var statesBoundaries = L.geoJson(response, { itemtype: 'Administrative Area',
    title: 'United States of America'
}).addTo(map)
// We must call annotate() explicitly on geographical Overlays such as this GeoJSON Layer
statesBoundaries.annotate()
</pre>

### Status

 * Proof of concept integrated with the Leaflet API
